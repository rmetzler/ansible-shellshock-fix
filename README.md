# update Bash on Debian / Ubuntu and RedHat

I copied this code from https://raymii.org/s/articles/Patch_CVE-2014-6271_Shellshock_with_Ansible.html
Thanks to Remy van Elst for writing this code.

I wanted to learn Ansible for a while now and want to and this example was really helpful.

If you want to make this work for your servers, you'll need to have a an [Ansible Inventory File](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_inventory.html).
